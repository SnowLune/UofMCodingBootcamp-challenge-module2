            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               I have always been naturally curious, and I approach my work with
               passion and a strong desire to be an essential part of a team.
               I'm eager to start my career in IT and I love to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
               Computers have been a big part of my life ever since I was 5
               years old and played around install a new operating system on the
               family computer. In my teens I became really interested in
               efficient software and operating systems. I installed my first
               Linux distribution when I was 13 on the same, now old, IBM
               computer I had tried to install Windows ME on when I was 5.

               I became very interested in software and coding when I was 17 and
               started to learn JavaScript online. I've since gained a lot of
               knowledge and even more intrigue in all manner of programming and
               design, but especially use of low-level languages and language
               features.
